Some projects from three weeks ago, I started to learn how to use the argv[] and argc(), and how to creat, compilate and run a file in the CMD (Linux and Windows).
In this project the user defines a number with the parameters of the CMD, and then we have to print the maximum square before that number. (Entrance 29 / Exit 25).
